# VIC-20
All my old VIC-20 code

Can you identify the tune in "music"? I was not sure if it was something I wrote back then.

Also, the "sound effects" I think ones I made, based on examples in the manual. Are any of those familiar?

* **creative computing 1983-01** - two programs I typed in from this issue - 8x8 Create, and Brain Warp.
* **music** - I found this on one of my tapes, in between programs I wrote. I do not know if I found this somewhere, or wrote it. Can you help?
* **my new programs** - some things I wrote for blog posts on my site as I am re-learning the VIC.
* **my old programs** - programs I wrote back in 1982-1983.
* **stellarbase** - I expect this came from a magazine. Can anyone identify it?
* **super expander** - things for the Super Expander cartridge. If any of these did not come from the manual, let me know -- I know I did a few programs using it but don't remembe rwhat I did, other than the CHUG (Commodore Houston Users Group) logo.
* **vic-20 manual games** - programs from the VIC-20 manual that I typed in. But, they are different. Did I have an earlier manual revision, or did I make these changes? (I think I may have added the stars on one of them. I used the same technique in one of my programs. Or, I saw it in this version and decided to put it in mine.)

More to come...
